# Branch: pp482-bigblade 

This branch is almost the same as tapeout_bigblade, except that the default
simulation setup is RTL-soft instead of RTL-hard. This means anyone who has
not signed the GF14 NDA can still safely run bigblade simulations (either
driven by the bare-metal C runtime, CUDA-Lite, or PyTorch).

# Overview 

This repo contains the **bsg\_manycore** source code with contributions from the [Bespoke Silicon Group](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mbtaylor/research_team.html) and others.

The tile based architecture is designed for computing efficiency, scalability and generality. The two main components are:

* **Computing Node:** Purpose-designed RISC-V 32IMF compatible core runs at 1.4GHz@16nm, but nodes also can be any other accelerators.
* **Mesh Network  :** Dimension ordered, single flit network with inter-nodes synchronization primitives (mutex, barrier etc.)

Without any custom circuits, a 16nm prototype chip with 16x31 tiles on a 4.5x3.4 mm^2 die space achieves **812,350**
aggregated [CoreMark](https://www.eembc.org/coremark/) score, a world record. Many improvements have been made since this previous version.

# Initial Setup for running programs

Above this directory:

- Checkout `basejump_stl`; cd into imports directory and type `make DRAMSim3`
- Checkout `bsg_cadenv`

In this directory:

- `make checkout_submodules`: To update all submodules in `imports/`.
- `make tools`: To install software toolchain required running programs on BSG Manycore. (This build uses 12-16 threads by default.)
- `make machines`: Compile simulation executables in `machines/`.
- Edit `BSG_MACHINE_PATH` in `software/mk/Makefile.paths` to choose the machine to run somd programs on.
- go into `software/spmd/bsg_barrier` and type `make` to run a test!

# Contributions

If you're developing on a branch called `mybranch`, please pull a branch called `ci_mybranch` based
on `mybranch` to run CI and `mybranch`. It's advised to keep working on `mybranch` for incremental
updates and rebase `ci_mybranch` on `mybranch` when it's ready for another CI run.

Comming Soon!
